# Program TI devices using Uniflash
CCS Uniflash is a standalone tool used to program on-chip flash memory on TI MCUs and on-board flash memory for Sitara processors. Uniflash has a GUI, command line, and scripting interface. CCS Uniflash is available free of charge.<br>
Okay! Now letâ€™s see how to program on-chip flash memory using Uniflash.<br>
For more details refer [TI's Website](https://www.ti.com/tool/UNIFLASH)

Follow the steps for getting started:
* Connect the USB to TTL(CP2102) to USB port of PC and open device manager to check the port connected to serial bridge (USB to TTL).<br>

* Open the port to which your serial device is connected make sure to check serial configuration as follows:<br>
    Baudrate : 9600<br>
    Data Bits : 8<br>
    Parity : None<br>
    Stopbits : 1<br>
